fs.jwt
======

This side project showcases on using JWT as an authorization
tool, using express as the server. if you don't want to make
your own HTTP calls, use the __webpage (React) to access the
server.

However, the React front-end isn't so secure because i rely on
localStorage since you can't store anything past 4069 B on a
cookie.

The server assumes the data has already been created, it should
be located at `__server/data/user.ts`, the registered username
should be youkwhd and so does for the password, you can tweak
it as your please.

Making HTTP Calls
---------------

I have made scripts for this kind of automation, located at
`__server/scripts/net.sh`
